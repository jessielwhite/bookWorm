There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  <!-- >> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
  My app is : bookWorm


## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  bookWorm is an organizational tool for book lovers.

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  Do you love to read? Do you find yourself on the lookout for your next great read even though you already have several lists of must-read books on scraps of paper or piling up in notes on your phone, often in no coherent order? Then you need bookWorm! It's an app designed to help you organize your existing lists of books you plan on reading into a single list with optional subcategories, and allow you to update your list and reprioritize whenever you find your next great read!

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
Avid book readers often have many different books to read at any one time; they also often are perhaps a bit too preoccupied with ideas and words to organize their reading goals and not lose track of any books! bookWorm solves this dilemma by allowing its users to easily organize their existing lists of books and update this list and reorganize it whenever they want to add a new book or mark another as already read, all while giving them easy access to their lists whenever they want!

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
bookWorm uses an API from which to retrieve information about the books its users may want to read. It also allows its users to save books they want to read safely to its database, mark books they've read as "read", and to add new books to their lists(s) and reorganize the order of the books they plan on reading whenever they feel the need.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
